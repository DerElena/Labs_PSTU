 We meet with music in early childhood,
 when a caring mother sings a lullaby to the child. 
Childhood passes, but the music is like a loyal friend,
 continues to follow us.
 Music also helps people learn. 
Music is the most beautiful art form that 
gives people energy and good mood.
Music is beautiful. 
Classical music can help you to study. Listening to music you may become better.
